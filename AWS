1. Types of Instances?
  General purpose
        General Purpose instances are designed to deliver a balance of compute, memory, and network resources. They are suitable for a wide range of 
        applications, including web servers, small databases, development and test environments, and more.

  Compute optimized
        Compute Optimized instances are ideal for compute bound application that requires high performance processor, these instance are well suited 
        for such as batch processing, scientific modeling, gaming servers, and high-performance web servers.

  Memory optimized
        Memory Optimized instances are designed to handle memory-intensive workloads. They are suitable for applications that require large amounts 
        of memory, such as in-memory databases, real-time big data analytics, and high-performance computing.

  Storage optimized
        Storage Optimized instances are optimized for applications that require high, sequential read and write access to large datasets. 
        They are ideal for tasks like data warehousing, log processing, and distributed file systems.

3. CloudFormation?
    AWS CloudFormation is a service that allows you to define and provision infrastructure as code, enabling you to create, update, and manage AWS 
    resources in a declarative and automated way.

4. CloudFront?
    Amazon CloudFront is a Content Delivery Network (CDN) service provided by AWS that accelerates content delivery by distributing it across a 
    network of edge locations.
    - Edge locations are data centers globally distributed by CloudFront. They store cached content and serve it to users, minimizing the distance 
      data needs to travel.

5.Cloudtrail?
    AWS CloudTrail is a service that provides governance, compliance, and audit capabilities by recording and storing API calls made on your AWS 
    account.
    - CloudTrail records API calls, capturing information about who made the call, when it was made, which service was accessed, and what actions 
      were taken.
    - CloudTrail stores its data in Amazon S3 buckets, allowing you to easily analyze and retrieve the recorded information.

6. CloudWatch?
    Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring service that provides insights into your AWS resources and applications by collecting and 
    tracking metrics, logs, and events.
    - Amazon CloudWatch collects metrics, logs, and events. Metrics are data points about your resources and applications, logs are textual data 
      generated by resources, and events provide insights into changes and notifications.

7. Lambda 
    AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that lets you run code without handling servers. It automatically scales and manages the 
    infrastructure required to run your code in response to events.

8. Route53
    Amazon Route 53 is a Domain Name System (DNS) web service that helps route end-user requests to AWS resources or external endpoints.
    - DNS (Domain Name System) is a system that translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses, allowing computers to locate resources 
      on the internet.

9. Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)?
    An Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) is a AWS service that automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, 
    such as Amazon EC2 instances, containers, or IP addresses, to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.
    - There are three types of Elastic Load Balancers:
        Application Load Balancer (ALB),
        Network Load Balancer (NLB),
        Gateway Load Balancer.


10. VPC
      virtual private cloud (VPC) is a virtual network dedicated to your AWS account. It is logically isolated from other virtual networks in the 
      AWS Cloud. You can specify an IP address range for the VPC, add subnets, gateways, and security groups.

1.CIDR
     - Classless Inter-Domain Routing - When you create a VPC, you must specify a range of IPv4 addresses for the VPC in the form of CIDR.

2.Subnet
     - Subnet is a logical subdivision of an IP network. It is a range of IP-address in your VPC. You can launch AWS resources into a specified 
       subnet.

3.Route Table
     - It is a interface which connects IGW, NAT, subnets in the VPC. It helps to configure route by specifying gateway and associate specific 
       subnets to the table.

4.Internet Gateway 
     - It is a gateway which is connected to the VPC to route traffic to and from the internet.

5.NAT Gateway 
     - It is a gateway through which resources in the private subnet can get access to the internet. A NAT Gateway is a device used to enable 
       instances in a private subnet to connect to the internet or other AWS services.

6.VPC Peering
    - A VPC peering connection is a networking connection between two VPCs that enables you to route traffic between them using private IPv4 
      addresses or IPv6 addresses.

7.Security Groups
    - It is a stateful service which acts like a firewall at the instance level to route inbound and outbound traffic by defining inbound and 
      outbound rules.

8.Network ACL
    - Network ACL is a stateless service work as firewall to the subnet level which route inbound and outbound traffic to the subnet by  
      configuring inbound and outbound rules.

9.VPC Endpoints
     - A VPC endpoint enables customers to privately connect to supported AWS services and VPC endpoint services powered by AWS PrivateLink.
     - so it doesn't require public IP addresses to communicate with resources of the service. Traffic between an Amazon VPC and a service does 
       not leave the Amazon network.
     - 2 types of endpoints
                    - Gateway endpoints – for Amazon S3 and Dynamo DB
                    - Interface endpoints – Many services listed below

10.Bastion Host or Jump Server
    - BASTION host are EC2 instances present in the public subnet and connected to the private instance in the private subnet inorder to route 
      traffic from external network to the private instance. It is used to communicate instances in the private subnet.

11.VPN – Virtual Private Network
    - It is a tunnel established to the private network to access resources using private IP address.
    - There are two types of VPN
        1. Site-to-site VPN - A secure connection between your on-premises equipment and your VPCs.
        2. Client VPN       - is a managed client-based VPN service that enables you to securely access AWS resources and resources in your    
                              on-premises network.
