1. Types of Instances?
  General purpose
        General Purpose instances are designed to deliver a balance of compute, memory, and network resources. They are suitable for a wide range of 
        applications, including web servers, small databases, development and test environments, and more.

  Compute optimized
        Compute Optimized instances are ideal for compute bound application that requires high performance processor, these instance are well suited 
        for such as batch processing, scientific modeling, gaming servers, and high-performance web servers.

  Memory optimized
        Memory Optimized instances are designed to handle memory-intensive workloads. They are suitable for applications that require large amounts 
        of memory, such as in-memory databases, real-time big data analytics, and high-performance computing.

  Storage optimized
        Storage Optimized instances are optimized for applications that require high, sequential read and write access to large datasets. 
        They are ideal for tasks like data warehousing, log processing, and distributed file systems.
